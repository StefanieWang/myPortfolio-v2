# My Portfolio-v2

This is the second version of my first portfolio built with HTML5, CSS3, and Resoposive Design.

1. Responsive design: flexbox and @media

2. Interactive showcase:  CSS3 transition effect on hover (project descriptions slide up).

3. All projects are linked to relevant repositories on Github.

I improved my resoponsive design and css transition & transform skills while making this portfolio.
However, I am not quite happy with this version :(.
