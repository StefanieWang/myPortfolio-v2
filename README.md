# My Portfolio-v2

This is the second version of my first portfolio built with HTML5, CSS3, and Resoposive Design.

1. The showcase projects are designed as cards which will flip over on hover. 

2. For each project card, the front side is a sreenshot of the project, and the back side will be a simple description of the project.

3. All cards are linked to relevant repositories on Github.

I improved my resoponsive design and css transition & transform skills while making this portfolio.
However, I am not quite happy with this version :(.
